# product-insights

In every company, we ask ourselves the same questions as the business grows. 

* "What should be the ideal ratio of QA testers to developers?
* "What is the ideal size of an IT support team for a company of my size?"
* "What is the ideal ratio of people to product for a startup?"
etc...

I'll try to collect data points from a wide range of companies, so that you can quickly use that for your own benchmarks. 
For each question, you'll find here a link to a google form to contribute, and a link to the results file.

Feel free to contribute.

If every you want to ask something to the community, send me an email to hlassiege (on gmail)
